# Opengl-Playground

This is my personal playground to learn OpenGL.

## Dependency Libraries

- glm (Mathematics library for OpenGL)
- glfw (Window system related)
- glew (OpenGL extensions wrangler)
- SOIL (For texture loading)

## Project Description

- 1-Startup
  Skeleton project to start.
- 2-SphereTexture
  A project demonstrated texture usage.

## How to compile

- First, you should install CMake as we use it to manage the whole project.
- Then, generate compilation projects(such as Visual Studio on Windows, Xcode for macOS, Makefile for Unix based system).
- Last but not least, compile the project and run all of them.
